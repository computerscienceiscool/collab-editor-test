 Why Trim Hydrangeas?

Hydrangeas benefit from a light trim to encourage them to use their energy to make new flowers and thicker stems. A light trim is defined as just removing the spent flowerheads, called deadheading, or up to one-third of the stem. Don’t confuse trimming a hydrangea with pruning.                     

Pruning hydrangeas involves cutting off more than a third of the shrub's stems or even cutting it down to the ground. The biggest mistake people make with hydrangeas is cutting too much off them at one time. Hydrangeas do best when you trim lightly.

Resist the urge to prune a hydrangea to fit into a smaller space. A plant is going to get as big as its genetics tell it to. If you want a small plant, buy a variety that is bred to be small. If you’ve got a hydrangea that’s too big for its spot, put down the pruners and transplant it to a new spot while it’s dormant where it will have room to grow. Replace it with a smaller variety.

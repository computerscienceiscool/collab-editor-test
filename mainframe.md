Mainframe computers are powerful, high-performance computers used by large organizations for critical applications like bulk data processing and high-volume transaction processing. They are known for their reliability, security, and high throughput, handling tasks such as census data, enterprise resource planning, and financial transactions. Modern mainframes can connect to thousands of users concurrently and are still essential for many everyday operations despite the rise of cloud computing. 
Functions and applications

    Transaction processing: Mainframes excel at processing millions of transactions per second, making them ideal for financial institutions (credit cards, ATM withdrawals) and airlines.
    Bulk data processing: They are used for large-scale data-intensive applications like census data, industry and consumer statistics, and enterprise resource planning (ERP).
    Enterprise-level tasks: Mainframes serve as a central, reliable system for managing complex databases and applications that require high security, resiliency, and scalability.
    Unified backend: They can act as a single, powerful system that supports multiple users and applications simultaneously without impacting performance. 

Key characteristics

    High throughput: They are designed to process data at a high rate, prioritizing overall throughput over the raw processing power of a single task.
    Reliability: Mainframes are engineered with extensive redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms, similar to those in commercial aircraft, to ensure continuous operation and allow for component replacement without downtime.
    Scalability: They can handle massive workloads and, in many cases, can run thousands of virtual servers simultaneously.
    Security: Mainframes are designed with a high degree of security, making them suitable for handling sensitive data.
    Physical size: Originally, the term referred to the large cabinets housing the CPU and memory; today, they are still large, often the size of a refrigerator, and require secure data centers. 

Mainframes vs. other computers

    Mainframes vs. Supercomputers: Mainframes are built for high-volume transactions and input/output (IO), while supercomputers are built for complex, single-task computations.
    Mainframes vs. PCs: Mainframes are designed to serve many users and large-scale tasks simultaneously, whereas personal computers (PCs) are designed for individual use.
